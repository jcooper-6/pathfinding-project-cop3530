Pathfinding Visualizer (SFML)

This project is a pathfinding visualizer built in C++ using SFML 2.6.1.
It allows you to draw terrain, set start/goal points, and watch two algorithms, Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* Search explore the grid and find a path.

Features

Forest (medium cost)

River (high cost)

Mountain (very high cost)

Eraser

Start (S) and Goal (G) selection

Dijkstra and A* visualization

Results display:

Number of visited cells

Time taken (ms)
